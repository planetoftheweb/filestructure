    <h2>Gummy Bears</h2>
    <img src="../images/gummies.jpg" height="500" alt="Photo of Gummy Bears">
    <p>What is actually lighting this picture is the edges. This picture uses a glassy floor, a black matte poster board as a background and two white poster boards on each side of the black one, which is actually what is lighting the gummy bears.</p>
    <p>There is one Vivitar 285HV flash beneath the table. The black matte background is flush to the table so no light passes through it. I got two of my kids to hold each of the white poster boards on each side slightly tilted towards the glass.</p>
    <p>This was a tough shot to achieve. I had to play around with the RAW file conversion to get everything just right, but I'm pleased with the results.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, as I covered up the glass with a plastic wrap to store it in the refrigerator, the glass cracked and all of the gummies were lost...snif. I did originally have to lighten the load on the glass manually by consuming some of the products which my kids were happy to help with so at least we had some, it's just a tragedy to loose so many.</p>
